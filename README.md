Mutation Testing Report
Introduction:
Mutation testing is a powerful technique used to assess the effectiveness of a test suite by introducing artificial faults (mutations) into the source code and observing how well the tests can detect these mutations. In this report, we present the results and analysis of mutation testing conducted on the Polynomial class in the mutTest.py file.

List of Defined Mutation Operators:
Coefficient Change Operator: Mutate the coefficients of the polynomial.
Arithmetic Operation Change Operator: Mutate arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
Redundant Code Operator: Introduce redundant code to evaluate the test suite's ability to detect unnecessary complexity.
Description of Applied Mutations and Their Impact:
Coefficient Change Operator:

Mutated the coefficient of a term in the polynomial.
Impact: Some mutants were detected by the test suite, indicating sensitivity to coefficient changes.
Arithmetic Operation Change Operator:

Mutated arithmetic operations in the polynomial's methods (__add__, __sub__, __mul__).
Impact: Detected mutants exposed the test suite's ability to identify changes in arithmetic operations.
Redundant Code Operator:

Introduced redundant code in the polynomial's evaluation method (evaluate).
Impact: Some redundant mutants went undetected, highlighting potential areas for improvement in test coverage.
Summary of Mutant Survival and Killing:
Survived Mutants:

Some mutants survived, indicating potential weaknesses in the test suite.
Survivors were mainly related to the introduction of redundant code.
Killed Mutants:

Mutants related to coefficient changes and arithmetic operation changes were effectively killed by the test suite.
The majority of mutants were successfully detected, demonstrating the robustness of the test suite.
Analysis of the Test Suite's Effectiveness:
The test suite demonstrated strong coverage and effectiveness in detecting mutations related to changes in coefficients and arithmetic operations. However, some mutants related to redundant code were not identified, suggesting that certain areas of the code might lack coverage.

Recommendations for Improving the Test Suite:
Enhance Redundant Code Detection:

Introduce additional test cases specifically designed to detect redundant code.
Review and modify existing test cases to improve coverage in areas where redundant code was not detected.
Consider Edge Cases:

Evaluate the test suite's behavior on edge cases and extreme input values to ensure comprehensive coverage.
Diversify Test Cases:

Introduce a variety of test cases to cover different polynomial configurations and edge cases.
Conclusion:
Mutation testing has provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the test suite for the Polynomial class. While the test suite has demonstrated strength in detecting certain mutations, improvements can be made to enhance coverage, especially in scenarios involving redundant code. The recommendations outlined above aim to further strengthen the test suite and ensure its reliability in identifying potential faults in the codebase.
